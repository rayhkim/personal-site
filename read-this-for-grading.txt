The site is deployed at rayhkim.herokuapp.com
Alternatively the github repo is at https://github.com/rayhkim/personal-site.git

I decided to make the website a webapp using React after getting the okay from Jarrod. But because I started learning React
very recently, it may not be following all the conventions.
